## About me

Hello! My name is Mia, and I'm a student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) studying mathematics and computer science. I'm also an undergraduate researcher at the [Computational Neurobiology Lab](https://cnl.salk.edu/) at the Salk Institute, where I work on building biologically-plausible learning algorithms.

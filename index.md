Hi! I'm Mia and I'm a student at [UC San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) studying Computer Science and Math, and a undergraduate researcher at the [Sejnowski Lab](https://cnl.salk.edu/) at the Salk Institute. 
I am interested understanding the algorithms of the brain, and their applications in neuroscience and AI. Currently, I am researching biologically-plausible learning algorithms for neural networks.

Outside of neuroscience, I like [reading]({{site-url}}{% link _pages/readinglog.md %}), mathematical proofs, playing the guitar and weightlifting!

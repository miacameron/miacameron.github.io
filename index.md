## About me

Hello! My name is Mia, and I'm a recent graduate of UC San Diego, where I studied Mathematics and Computer Science. I'm currently an RA at the (Salk Institute)[https://www.salk.edu], advised by (Dr. Yusi Chen)[https://yschen13.github.io], (Dr. Margot Wagner)[https://www.margotwagner.com] and (Prof. Terrence Sejnowski)[https://cnl.salk.edu], where I worked on developing predicting-coding inspired, bio-plausible learning rules for deep and recurrent neural networks. Currently, I am working on a project exploring the effect of biologically-inspired inductive biases for memorization tasks in modern RNN and SSM architectures. 

Broadly, I am interested in applying methods and insights from deep learning, dynamical systems theory, and functional analysis to problems in systems neuroscience. In particular, I am motivated by the questions of how learning, inference and memory (both long-term and working) are implemented in neural circuits, using RNNs as interpretable models of information processing. Conversely, I am also interested in how experimentally-observed paradigms from neuroscience can be translated into more scalable and efficient algorithms for machine learning.

*I am currently looking for post-bac RA positions for 2025-2026, so please reach out for a chat if you think we'd be a good fit!*

Outside of the lab, I enjoy (reading)[https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134711669-mia-cameron], playing the guitar and going to the beach!

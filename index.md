Hi! I'm Mia and I'm a student at UC San Diego studying Computer Science and Math, and a undergraduate researcher at the Sejnowski Lab at the Salk Institute. 
I am interested understanding the algorithms of the brain, and the relationship between 
neuroscience and AI. 

Currently, I am interested in biologically-plausible learning algorithms for neural networks, as alternatives to backpropagation that could potentially be implemented in real brains.

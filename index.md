Hello! My name is Mia, and I'm a student at UC San Diego studying mathematics and computer science. I am also an undergraduate researcher at the [Computational Neurobiology Lab](https://cnl.salk.edu/) at the Salk Institute, where I worked on modelling the hippocampus with artifical neural networks, and building biologically-plausible learning algorithms.

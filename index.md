Hi! I'm Mia and I'm a student at [UC San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) studying Computer Science and Math, and a undergraduate researcher at the [Sejnowski Lab](https://cnl.salk.edu/) at the Salk Institute. 
I am interested understanding the algorithms of the brain, and the relationship between 
neuroscience and AI. 

Currently, I am interested in biologically-plausible learning algorithms for neural networks.
